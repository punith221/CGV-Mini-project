# CGV-Mini-project
The main aim of this Working of a Satellite Computer Graphics Mini Project is to illustrate the concepts and usage of pre- built functions in OpenGL..
 
A Satellite is an object which has been placed into orbit by human endeavor. Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as the Moon. 

Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites, communications satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites. We have used input devices like mouse and key board to interact with program. In the project, the transmitter transmits signals to the satellite from the ground base. 

The satellite is responsible for transmitting(broadcasting) the received signals to all the antennas. The receivers are placed on top of the buildings in order to prevent interruptions.
